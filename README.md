# RetroTvChat

### Team Members:
Jessica Knoblock, Michael Taylor, Timothy Papich

### Vision Statement
We will be producing a retro-themed online video conferencing app. It will be free to use, requiring only your Facebook account to sign up. You'll be able to easily video chat with friends and connect with family in a trendy, old-school interface.

### Motivation
The primary motivations for this project are to gain valuable experience using technologies that are in high demand and boost our portfolios by creating a functioning app that has real-world utility. Some skills we hope to improve upon specifically are the software development process, Angular web framework, and UX design.

### Risks
Many of us are new to software development and have little experience with many of the languages and technologies required for this project including the use of frameworks and front-end development. Additionally, the members of our team have only just met each other, live in different time zones with different schedules, and have varying degrees of knowledge and skills related to this project. Further, we are all students with jobs so time and availability will impose a significant constraint.

### Mitigation Strategies
In order to mitigate these issues we will be putting an emphasis on early scheduling and deadline attainment. A key part of our strategy early on will be to identify gaps in our knowledge, collect the appropriate study materials, aggregate code examples snippets before beginning work, and make wireframes for documenting what the UI will look like. Throughout the entire process, functionality will be prioritized based on MVP so that our base goals for the project can be achieved.

### Development Method
We have decided on a modified scrum/waterfall hybrid for our development process. This way we will be able to have externally set deadlines (waterfall), while meeting semi-weekly for standups to identify blockers and reprioritize tickets (scrum). Each week we will also take time for backlog grooming and sprint planning.

### Project Tracking Software
GitHub and Clubhouse will be used for version control and project tracking.
